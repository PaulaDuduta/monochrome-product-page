              Mr Max Bill was a true creative genius, carving out a career as a
              painter, architect, sculptor and designer. As well as leaving
              behind an expansive body of work, he was also an avid collector of
              watches, and this Junghans chronoscope timepiece is dedicated to
              his memory. Immaculately housed in a domed Plexiglass case and
              finished with a handsome leather strap, it&apos;s a highly
              technical piece in a stylish package.
